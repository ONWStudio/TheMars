    m_Localized: 'You''ve decided to prioritize nature restoration for humanity''s
      future on Mars.

      You''ve decided to collaborate as much as possible
      with companies that can produce nature in an environmentally friendly way

      and
      you''ve decided to ask them for help. Although terraforming is slow

      In
      the long run, the Martian ecosystem will be able to become self-sustaining.

      Although
      there will be pushback from some in the scientific community along the way,
      the results of restoring nature should give everyone hope.'
