    m_Localized: 'You raised your hand to theirs, thinking that a little more science
      would help.

      Scientific progress was prioritized for human survival
      and comfort, and because of this, development on Mars

      has been so rapid
      that it has surpassed that of Earth.

      At the same time, however, nature
      has been completely destroyed and ecosystems are close to impossible to restore.

      Despite
      the brilliance of science''s achievements, the light at the end of the tunnel
      was still dark.'
