    m_Localized: "Determined to conduct an in-house investigation, I formed an investigation
      team and recruited reliable personnel from various departments.\r\nWhen the
      investigation began, we combed through the relevant documents and emails. \r\nLooking
      at past meeting records, I focused on finding hidden patterns. \r\nIn the process,
      I also conducted interviews with some employees. \r\nThey shared their honest
      opinions, and I listened to their voices."
