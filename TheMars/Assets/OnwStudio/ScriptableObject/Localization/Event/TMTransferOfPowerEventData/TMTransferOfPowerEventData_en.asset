    m_Localized: 'Your inability to correct the confusion of the council has eventually
      led to a backlash from the closest staff.

      The government turns to the
      person who''s closest to you, and eventually you get kicked out of the government''s
      chess horse.

      All the policies and ideals you have left behind will
      be revised at the hands of the new commander, and the citizens will forget
      you.

      The power flows towards him and you are no longer the leader of
      this place.'
