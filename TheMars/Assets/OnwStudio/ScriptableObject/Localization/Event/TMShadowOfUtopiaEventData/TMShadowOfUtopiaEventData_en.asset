    m_Localized: "As a result of being fully responsive to the needs of its inhabitants,
      Mars has turned into a remarkable social utopia.\r\nThe citizens enjoy a high
      quality of life, and the governing council proudly proclaims their success.\r\nBut
      behind this perfect society lies a rapidly worsening resource shortage and
      a looming economic crisis.\r\nWhile seemingly perfect on the surface, the utopia
      is beginning to cast its shadow, \r\nand questions of sustainability may be
      rising."
