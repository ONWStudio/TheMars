      Although there was no monetary change, the lives of your citizens steadily
      improved and your government's support stabilized. \r\nOver time, your policies
      will be referred to as a \u201Clegacy of hope\u201D and Mars will continue
      its slow but steady progress.\r\n Future generations will remember your careful
      decisions and realize that the foundation of Martian society was built on your
      choices."
