    m_Localized: "You set up a corporate monitoring committee to monitor corporate
      activities and ensure transparency.\r\nBut the commission operates poorly without
      real authority, and companies take advantage of this opportunity to set up
      a commission \r\nThey cooperated with their side to hide their actions and
      concealed this fact.\r\nAs a result, citizens believe that the committee is
      thoroughly monitoring the activities of the company, and they enjoy a false
      sense of stability."
