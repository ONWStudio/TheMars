    m_Localized: "Your political failure and the incompetence of the self-governing
      council have pushed the patience of the citizens to the limit.\r\nThey called
      for the dissolution of the self-governing committee and staged a massive strike
      and protest movement. \r\nThe union represented the voices of the citizens
      and demanded a new political system,\r\nYou were crushed by their pressure.\r\nMars
      may now enter a new era led by workers or become more devastated.\r\nYou will
      go down in history as a failed leader."
